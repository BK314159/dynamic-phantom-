Dynamic phantom 3D models:
Description: 3D printable dynamic phantom designs suitable for single mouse bed. Capable of imitating the reversible and irreversible two-compartment pharmacokinetic models.
Including: 7x2.2x2cm cubic frame with separable 200μl compartments, 8x2.3x2.3cm

Dynamic phantom analysis code:
Description: Calculates the rate constants of the dynamic phantom’s output compartment in the reversible configuration. It can also simulate dynamic data on which the analysis method can be validated. Its parameters are the volumes and concentrations of the compartments at given time points, along with the flow rate of the system. For the output compartment it fits for the differential equation form of the two-compartment model. Although for the input compartment there are options for spline or differential fit, it is not turned on originally.
Including: Irreversible/reversible two-compartment analysis code, two-compartment model simulation for analysis check.
